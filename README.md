# ShopX-DS-Challenge

Notes for reviewer:

* Solutions are built using Jupyter notebooks (Forecast.ipynb, Segmentation.ipynb)
* R was used as a scratchpad - rapid poc, exploratory data analyses, etc. (Analysis.R)
* Outputs are stored in /Output
* Additional context and presentation material, specifically around the segmentation, will be given during the presentation
